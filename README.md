# EasyRP (Custom Discord Rich Presence)

EasyRP is a small program to use the discord-rpc, to make a custom rich presence/game on discord.  
using just an easy config file.

**Usage**
- First you need to register a Rich Presence application with discord
     - Go here https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
     - Make a new application **The name of the app will be the main name for the rich presence**
     - Enable rich presence for your app and add some assets
- Download the latest release of EasyRP from here https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP/releases 
  - if you are on Windows you also need [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48145)  
- Edit the config file (use the asset names for the image names) with the information from your newly registered app
- Run the [EasyRP executable](https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP/releases) (it should open a cmd window)
    - It *should* report errors from your config file (if there are any)
- Discord should show the game on your profile
	- if not, add the exe as a game on discord and the file path should change to your presence

- You can edit the config any time while the program is running to change the presence (make sure to save the file)
 
**Timestamps**  
The Start and End timestamps are in epoch/unix time. 
Your desired values can be found [here](https://www.epochconverter.com/).
For elapsed time set only the StartTimestamp. For remaining time set both.
Though discord seems to only care about hours/minutes/seconds.
As it doesnt go above 24hrs either way ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

**Building**  
To build EasyRP from source you need the following
  - any c++ compiler (cl, g++, clang++, etc)
  - Meson
  - Ninja
  - CMake (for discord-rpc library)  
  
Build discord-rpc  
  - ``` git clone https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP --recurse-submodules ```  
  - ``` cd EasyRP/discord-rpc ```  
  - ``` mkdir build && cd build ```  
  - ``` cmake .. -DENABLE_IO_THREAD=OFF ``` -DENABLE_IO_THREAD option will prevent a link error (see [#49](https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP/issues/49))  
  
Now depending on your platform building the discord-rpc library will be different  
  - Unix: ``` make ```  
  - Windows (visual studio): ``` msbuild /p:Configuration=Release ```  
  - Windows (mingw): ``` mingw32-make.exe ```  
Now the library should be under src/[lib]discord-rpc.[lib|a], move that to the root of the EasyRP repo  
  
To build EasyRP (in the root of the repo)  
  - ``` meson --buildtype=release build ```  
  - ``` ninja -C build ```  
  
Now the EasyRP executable will be under the build directory!
