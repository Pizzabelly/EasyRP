# EasyRP (Custom Discord Rich Presence)

EasyRP is a small program to use the DiscordRPC library without any knowledge of programming.  
Instead just use an easy config file

**Usage**
- First you need to register a Rich Presence application with discord
     - Go here https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
     - Make a new application **The name of the app will be the main name for the rich presence**
     - Enable rich presence for your app and add some assets
- Download the latest release of EasyRP from here https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP/releases
- Edit the config file with the information from your newly registered app
- Run [EasyRP.exe](https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP/releases) (it should open a cmd window)
    - It should report errors from your config file (if there are any)
- Go into discord settings and add the [EasyRP.exe](https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP/releases) as a game
- Discord should automatically change the path of [EasyRP.exe](https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP/releases) to your Discord Rich Presence

- You can edit the config any time while the program is running to change the presence
